# Practical: Hashing and collisions


The Lecture dealt briefly with the theory behind hashing functions and 
hash table methods. 

You can also read a good introduction to the logic of these methods in 
<a href="https://livebook.manning.com/book/grokking-algorithms/chapter-5/ch05">Chapter 5 'hash tables'</a> of Grokking Algorithms.

A simple demonstration project on hashing, load factors for hash tables, 
and the problem of collisions is provided in the following Jupyter notebook:
* <a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARU-Bioinf-CMA-2020/tw1_hashing_collisions/master/Hashing_and_Collisions_notebook.ipynb'>Hashing_and_Collisions_notebook.ipynb</a> 
   *Direct link for the Jupyter Notebook - right click to Save Link As..

    https://colab.research.google.com/github/ARU-Bioinf-CMA-2020/tw1_hashing_collisions/blob/master/Hashing_and_Collisions_notebook.ipynb) 

Work through the notebook and then consider the following questions:

* What is an acceptable load factor for a hash table?
* What methods are available to deal with collisions during data storage in a hash table?
